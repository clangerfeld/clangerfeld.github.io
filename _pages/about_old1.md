# Bio
I am an Associate Professor of Digital Text Analysis at the Norwegian School of Economics (NHH) in Bergen, Norway, focusing on the study of professional and specialized communication. I have been in my current position since 2022. I hold a PhD degree form the University of Bergen and a Masters degree also from the University of Bergen.

My research employs corpus linguistics and NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques to analyze textual data from business related domains. Recently, I have been focusing my research on transcripts of meetings in the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). In 2023 I co-authored a paper on turn taking mechanisms in FOMC meetings.
